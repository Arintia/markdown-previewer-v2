### About
This is the second version of my markdown previewer. The code has been **completely** over-hauled as I wrote this one from scratch. Just like the previous one, customization has been at the forefront of my development process. As such, I took the pre-defined theming to the next level and gave the end-user the freedom to choose whichever color they want for both the background and the text. Furthermore, the new version introduces Dark Mode. For a full list of features, please check [Features](#features) Suggestions for further improvement are welcome. Check the to-do list down below for my current road map for this project.

### Features
- Fully customizable colors for both input and output(new in v2)
- Light/Dark Mode(new in v2)
- Export straight from the app(new in v2)
- Utilizes TypeScript instead of JavaScript! (new in v2)
- See the preview of the markdown you're typing out
- Reset the markdown with a single button click
